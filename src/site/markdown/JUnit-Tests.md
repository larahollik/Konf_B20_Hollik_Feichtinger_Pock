#Test coverage

The new feature **CashRegister.java** got 100% of the test coverage in IntelliJ.

###The new methods *addArticle(String day, String seller)* and calcPrice() are tested for each class.

- the class **CocktailTest.java** covers the test cases of *cocktail.addArticle(String day, String seller)* and *cocktail.calcPrice()*
- the class **LongDrinkTest.java** covers the test cases of *longDrink.addArticle(String day, String seller)* and *longDrink.calcPrice()*
- the class **JuiceTest.java** covers the test cases of *juice.addArticle(String day, String seller)* and *juice.calcPrice()*

The old test cases in the classes **CocktailTest.java**, **JuiceTest.java**, **LongDrinkTest.java** are deprecated and should not 
be used anymore.
